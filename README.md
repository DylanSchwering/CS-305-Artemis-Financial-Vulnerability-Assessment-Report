# CS-305-Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in financial planning services. The issue the client wanted addresses was identification and mitigation of software vulnerabilities as they attempt to modernize their system

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I effectively identified critizal security flaws within their codebase. It is important to code securely in order to protect against unauthorized access and ensure data integrity. Software security adds consumer trust and ensure compliance with regulations.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One of the challenging aspects was the manual code review, as well as resolving issues with the Maven dependency checker.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by using prepared statements, removing hard coded credentials and updating vulnerable dependencies. In the future I would employ automated tools alongside the manual code reviews.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After refactoring the code I ensured it remained functional and secure by rerunning the tests to verify that no new vulnerabilites were found.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The biggest tool that I believe will be helpful in the future will the the maven dependency checker.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignement I would showcase the completed vulnerability report and the steps I had taken to mitigate the issues identified.
